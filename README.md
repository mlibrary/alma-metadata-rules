# alma-metadata-rules

This is the backup respository for the metadata rules stored in alma. 

## How to use this repository

To create a rule, create a file in the appropriate folder (example: put a normalization rule in the `normalization` folder). Give the file the same name as the rule in Alma so that it's easy to identify the correct one.

To update a rule, find the corresponding file, click the edit button, then overwrite with file with contents of the current rule. Then add a "commit message" that summarizes the change that was made. 

To keep things simple: 
* all commits will be directly to the main branch
* use the github web user interface for updating this repository
